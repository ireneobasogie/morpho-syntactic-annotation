# morpho-syntactic-annotation

A project by Irene Roseline Obasogie (Eirini Rozalia Ompasogkie), Marina Seghier, Doruntina Fazliu and Regina Costa.

**Morpho-Syntactic Annotation Project**

As part of the "Corpus Enrichment" course, we carried out a morpho-syntactic annotation project on an article about "Game Of Thrones characters and their Pok√©mon counterparts" (https://www.crumpe.com/).
The main objective of this project was first and foremost to familiarize ourselves with the tool we chose, then to understand the difficulties of annotation, group work, and to discuss together the perception of annotations we had on the text based on different viewpoints.
We chose this text because there are many proper names of characters in this article, as well as in the subtitles that make it up.
Our work consisted of individual manual annotation, followed by automatic annotation using the "Visual Interactive Syntax Learning" software (https://visl.sdu.dk/visl/fr/), as well as writing a Python language script composed of several functions.

This report consists of 6 steps:

Manual annotation methodology
Automatic tagging
Calculation of precision, recall and F-measure
Problems encountered
The script 
Limits and possible improvements to our work.
